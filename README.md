Project Overview
This project is a personal profile webpage developed for the Elevate Labs Web Development Internship. The objective was to build a fully semantic, accessible webpage that follows modern industry standards for document structure and clean code.

Deliverables & Features
In alignment with the internship task guidelines:

Semantic HTML: Utilized logical elements such as <header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, and <footer> to divide content and improve accessibility.

Internal Navigation: Implemented anchor links in the navigation bar to allow smooth jumping to specific sections of the profile.

Accessibility: Included a profile image with descriptive alt attributes to follow best practices for screen readers.

Technical Structure: Manually wrote the HTML boilerplate (DOCTYPE, html, head, body) to ensure a strong understanding of how browsers interpret document structure.

Clean Code: Added descriptive comments throughout the code to explain why specific semantic elements were used instead of generic containers.

Technical Toolkit
Primary Editor: Visual Studio Code.

Browser Testing: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox to ensure consistent rendering.

Self-Research & AI Disclosure
As per the guideline allowing self-research and tutorials:

I collaborated with Gemini (AI) as a technical thought partner to optimize the CSS layout and refine the semantic hierarchy.

This process helped me focus on building a professional engineering aesthetic while ensuring all code remains fully compliant with the task's semantic requirements.
