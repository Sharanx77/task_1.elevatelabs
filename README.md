# Internship Task 1: Semantic HTML Personal Profile Page

## Overview
[cite_start]This repository contains my submission for Task 1 of the **Elevate Labs Web Development Internship**[cite: 3]. [cite_start]The objective was to build a personal profile page that demonstrates mastery of semantic HTML, accessibility, and clean document structure[cite: 18, 19].

## Deliverables Met
- [cite_start]**Semantic Structure**: I utilized `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to provide a logical hierarchy.
- [cite_start]**Accessibility**: All images include descriptive `alt` attributes, and headings follow a logical order[cite: 13, 18].
- [cite_start]**Internal Navigation**: The navigation bar uses anchor links (`#`) to jump to specific sections on the same page.
- [cite_start]**Documentation**: Comments are included in the HTML to explain the choice of semantic tags over generic containers.

## Self-Research & AI Collaboration
[cite_start]In accordance with the "Self-Research Allowed" policy[cite: 29, 30], I used **Gemini (AI)** as a thought partner to:
1. Refine the CSS layout for a more professional "Internship-ready" appearance.
2. Review my HTML structure to ensure maximum compliance with semantic standards.
3. Help draft this documentation to clearly communicate my technical choices.

## How to Run
1. Ensure `index.html` and the profile image are in the same folder.
2. [cite_start]Open `index.html` in any modern browser[cite: 5].
