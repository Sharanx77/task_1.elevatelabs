## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project is a personal profile webpage developed for the Elevate Labs Web Development Internship[cite: 2, 3]. [cite_start]The objective was to build a fully semantic, accessible webpage that follows modern industry standards for document structure and clean code[cite: 18, 19].

## Deliverables & Features
In alignment with the internship task guidelines:
- [cite_start]**Semantic HTML**: Utilized logical elements such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to divide content and improve accessibility.
- [cite_start]**Internal Navigation**: Implemented anchor links in the navigation bar to allow smooth jumping to specific sections of the profile.
- [cite_start]**Accessibility**: Included a profile image with descriptive `alt` attributes to follow best practices for screen readers[cite: 13].
- [cite_start]**Technical Structure**: Manually wrote the HTML boilerplate (DOCTYPE, html, head, body) to ensure a strong understanding of how browsers interpret document structure[cite: 10, 22].
- [cite_start]**Clean Code**: Added descriptive comments throughout the code to explain why specific semantic elements were used instead of generic containers[cite: 16].

## Technical Toolkit
- [cite_start]**Primary Editor**: Visual Studio Code[cite: 5].
- [cite_start]**Browser Testing**: Chrome, Edge, and Firefox to ensure consistent rendering[cite: 5, 15].

## Self-Research & AI Disclosure
[cite_start]As per the guideline allowing self-research and tutorials:
- I collaborated with **Gemini (AI)** as a technical thought partner to optimize the CSS layout and refine the semantic hierarchy.
- This process helped me focus on building a professional, "internship-ready" engineering aesthetic while ensuring all code remains fully compliant with the task's semantic requirements.
